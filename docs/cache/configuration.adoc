= Cache Configuration

This documentation explains how to configure the cache.

== Configuration and Quarkus

The cache is a Quarkus application and is configured via standard Quarkus configuration keys. This means that any config
key listed here can be overriden by both system properties, or by environment variables.

Note that to use environment variables you need to uppercase the config key and change all special characters to lowercase.
For example to override the `build-policy.default.store-list` config property you would set an environment variable
called `BUILD_POLICY_DEFAULT_STORE_LIST`.

== Configuring End User Build Policies

To function the cache must have at least one build policy configured, build policies are installed by listing
them in the `build-policies` config key.

This cache is configured to have a `default` configuration as follows:
`build-policies=default`.

Note that if no build config is provided by the client then the `default` build config will be used.

Every build policy should be configured to reference a list of remote artifact stores. When resolving artifacts these
stores are checked in order. To configure the remote stores you can use the `build-policy.$NAME.store-list` config key,
for example the default policy mentioned above looks like: `build-policy.default.store-list=central,redhat`.

Note that these properties are only for end user builds. The config used to rebuild artifacts is defined in the recipe repository.

=== Configuring Remote Artifact Stores

The following remote stores are supported:

* maven2

Each remote store must be given a name, and the names are referenced by the build policies as mentioned above. To configure
a remote artifact store you can use the following two properties:

* `store.$NAME.url`
* `store.$NAME.type`

The central config store that is part of the default config is configured as follows:

[source,properties]
----
store.central.url=https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2
store.central.type=maven2
----
