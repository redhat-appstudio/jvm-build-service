== Component Builder Images

These images are temporary builder images intended to be used during development. They are not intended to be used for production, as they
are not really optimised in any way.

They are largely based on the Quarkus tooling image, but using the UBI
image as a base.

At the moment there is a JDK8,11 and 17 version of the images, all with Maven 3.8 and Gradle 7.3.

=== CEKit and Building the Images

To build you need CEKit. We recommend using `virtualenv` to run `cekit`.
On MacOS X and Linux, you can run the build as follows:

```bash
virtualenv --python=python3 .cekit
source .cekit/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
./build.sh sdouglas latest podman
```
