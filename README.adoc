This repository contains components used to deploy the HACBS JVM build service.

See each component's directory for specific documentation. There is further documentation available within the docs
directory.

== Requirements

* OpenShift/Kubernetes cluster
* link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl[kubectl] CLI tool
* link:https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/installation/kustomize/binaries[kustomize] CLI tool

This is currently using link:https://docs.openshift.com/pipelines/1.15/about/op-release-notes.html[OpenShift Pipelines 1.15]

== Installation

The following environment variables are configurable and may be set by the user prior to deploying this depending upon which features are to be enabled.

|=======================
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | AWS Access Key used for S3 and CodeArtfact Access
| AWS_PROFILE | AWS Region used for CodeArtifact deployment
| AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | AWS Secret Access Key used for S3 and CodeArtfact Access
| GIT_DEPLOY_IDENTITY | Username/organisation name for the Git service
| GIT_DEPLOY_TOKEN | Authentication token
| GIT_DEPLOY_URL | The URL for the Git service (GitHub/GitLab are supported) to archive the sources
| GIT_DISABLE_SSL_VERIFICATION | Whether to disable SSL verification for Git archival service communication
| JBS_QUAY_IMAGE_CONTROLLER | The name for the operator image repository. Defaults to `hacbs-jvm-controller`.
| JBS_QUAY_IMAGE_TAG | The tag for the images (defaults to `dev`)
| JBS_QUAY_ORG | JBS images are pulled by default from the `QUAY_USERNAME` organization. This may be overridden by changing this
| JBS_BUILD_IMAGE_SECRET | Secret for accessing Quay.io (See below)
| JBS_GIT_CREDENTIALS | Support for private repositories (See below)
| JBS_MAX_MEMORY | Maximum additional memory allowed
| JBS_RECIPE_DATABASE | Recipe database to use (defaults to `https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/jvm-build-data`)
| JBS_S3_SYNC_ENABLED | Whether to enable Amazon S3 sync for storage (default: `false`)
| JBS_WORKER_NAMESPACE | Worker namespace (default: `test-jvm-namespace`) may be customised by setting this
| MAVEN_PASSWORD | Password for the Maven repository
| MAVEN_REPOSITORY | The URL for the external Maven repository to deploy to
| MAVEN_USERNAME | Username for the Maven repository
| QUAY_USERNAME | Quay.io registry to use
|=======================

The `$HOME/.docker/config.json` must contain a suitable authentication token to Quay.io. In the Account
section of Quay you should see an options to generate an encrypted CLI password. Select this option and create a `~/
.docker/config.json` by following the prompts. It is recommended to configure this secret as:

```
export JBS_BUILD_IMAGE_SECRET=$(cat $HOME/.docker/config.json | base64 -w 0)
```

To support private repositories set:
```
export JBS_GIT_CREDENTIALS='https://$GITHUB_E2E_ORGANIZATION:$GITHUB_TOKEN@github.com'
```
