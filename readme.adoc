== HACBS JVM Build Service

This repository contains components used to deploy the HACBS JVM build service.

See each component's directory for specific documentation.

=== KCP setup in anticipation of workspace resource controller

Working out of your clone of this repository, you have two paths for initializing everything to try and run
a test build againast a KCP enabled environment.

Specifically for our `make dev` based developer flow:

- continue to set `QUAY_USERNAME`, `QUAY_E2E_ORGANIZATION` and `QUAY_TOKEN` like we currently do in our developer flow.
- admittedly, `QUAY_USERNAME` and `QUAY_E2E_ORGANIZAION` may be the same in the developer flow i.e. your personal quay repository
- also set `QUAY_TAG` to `dev`
- image references will become `quay.io/$QUAY_USERNAME/hacbs-jvm-<controller|cache|build-request-processor>:dev`

Specifically testing against levels of the `quay.io/redhat-appstudio/hacbs-jvm-*` images from merged PRs:

- either unset `QUAY_USERNAME` or set it to `redhat-appstudio`
- set `QUAY_TAG` to the specific image/commit sha you want to test against
- leave `QUAY_E2E_ORGANIZATION` and `QUAY_TOKEN` the same, pointing to your personal quay repo, so that the artifact cache can still push its updates
- image references will become `quay.io/redhat-appstudio/hacbs-jvm-<controller|cache|build-request-processor>:$QUAY_TAG`

Common steps regardless of using developer images you build yourself or official `quay.io/redhat-appstudio` images:

- artifact cache images will be pushed to `quay.io/$QUAY_E2E_ORGANIZATION/....` using `QUAY_TOKEN` to authenticate on the push
- download `helm` via `curl -L https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/helm/latest/helm-linux-amd64 -o /usr/local/bin/helm`
- mimic the setting of `CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG` and `KCP_KUBECONFIG` as you have them set in your infra-deployments `preview.env` file
- from KCP, enter the `hacbs` workspace in the infra-deployments bootstrapped env, i.e. `oc ws hacbs`
- from KCP, create a test namespace i.e. `oc create ns jvm-bld-test`
- from KCP, enter that new test namespace i.e. `oc project jvm-bld-test` or `kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=jvm-bld-test`
- run `./deploy/init-hacbs-user-workspace-sa-rbac.sh` out of your clone of this repo against your compute/workload cluster where you have set `HACBS_WORKSPACE_NAMESPACE` to your KCP test namesapce i.e. `jvm-build-test`
- run `./deploy/init-hacbs-user-workspace.sh` out of your clone of this repo to initialize you KCP test namespace with the artifact cache and `Tasks` needed to run our test `Pipelines` and `PipelineRuns`
- then go to `./hack/examples` and pick which `Pipeline` and `PipelineRun` test to run.

=== Testing

==== Test JVM Build Service on an OpenShift cluster

The OpenShift E2E test is programmed to run a test with following steps:

. Create a new project in targeted OpenShift cluster and run the build pipeline which contains a link:./deploy/base/maven-v0.2.yaml[Maven] task from this repo to build the link:./hack/examples/run-e2e-shaded-app.yaml[simple java test project]
. Make sure the pipeline succeeds and all related artifactbuilds and dependecybuilds (triggered after pipeline completion) finish successfully
. Check that all "contaminated" builds are resolved
. Verify that triggering a second build accesses dependencies that are cached from a previous build
. Verify that the correct JDK version is identified in dependencybuilds
. Check that maven/gradle logs/sources are found in rebuilt artifacts

Before running the test, you need to export couple of env vars that reference container images for the operator, cache and reqprocessor. Some existing images can be found at link:https://quay.io/organization/redhat-appstudio[redhat-appstudio quay.io org] (search for keyword "jvm")

Also you need to specify your quay.io username that will be used for pushing rebuilt dependencies in a format: `quay.io/$QUAY_USERNAME/test-images`. Make sure the repo "test-images" exists in your account and is publicly available.
